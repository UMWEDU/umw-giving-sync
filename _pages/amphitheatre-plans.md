UMW is working with Glavé &amp; Holmes Architecture to finalize plans for the Amphitheatre. They are following Secretary of the Interior standards to preserve and restore the Amphitheatre, with the following goals:
<ul>
	<li>Restore it to its historical glory/memory</li>
	<li>Increase accessibility</li>
	<li>Upgrade the infrastructure and make it more flexible</li>
	<li>Add restroom facilities within close proximity</li>
	<li>Sustain and enhance the wooded, park-like setting</li>
</ul>
Drawings below are courtesy of Glavé &amp; Holmes Architecture:
