<a href="https://giving.umw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Large-Format-JPG1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-45981 size-medium" src="https://giving.umw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Large-Format-JPG1-300x239.jpg" alt="Large Format JPG[1]" width="300" height="239" /></a>For more than a century, the open air amphitheatre has been a central part of the Mary Washington experience. Hidden in the grove behind Lee and Trinkle Halls, this campus landmark has been the venue of choice for numerous commencements, May Day celebrations, plays, concerts, and even weddings.

Through the years, weather and time have not been kind. In 2012, consultants examined the site and said the amphitheatre must be restored or it could be lost forever. In 2014, UMW began a campaign to raise $3 million to fund this vital project. As of February 15, 2018, UMW has secured a total of $2.9 million in gifts and pledges toward the project's overall $3-million goal.

<a href="http://giving.umw.edu/blog/2018/02/19/amphitheatre-construction-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Construction is in progress</a>, and a ribbon-cutting ceremony is scheduled for June 2, 2018.

The University still needs your help to secure the final $100,000.  <a href="http://umw.edu/amphitheatre-gift" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Make a gift today to help complete the restoration of this cherished landmark.  </strong></a><em>Select <strong>"Amphitheatre Restoration"</strong> from the drop-down menu in the "Your Gift" section of the form.)
