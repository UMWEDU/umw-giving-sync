Opened in August 2011, this new multi-use facility adjacent to Goolrick Hall now provides basketball courts and seating for 2,000 spectators at UMW men’s and women’s varsity games, and seating for up to 3,000 for concerts and other community events.

Named to honor the 23 years of service by the University's sixth president, the William M. Anderson Center is open to students and the public. It is an ideal space to highlight names of loyal and dedicated alumni, parents, friends, and business leaders who support the mission of the University of Mary Washington.
<p style="margin-bottom: 0">There are many ways to add your name to this new Center.  Dedicate a seat by making a gift of $2,000 to the <span style="font-weight: bold">Fund for Mary Washington</span>, or put your name on one of the many new spaces available within the facility.  Call the Office of University Advancement at (540) 654-1024 for more information.</p>
