<h3>About Devil-Goat Day</h3>
Devil-Goat Day is Mary Washington's favorite springtime tradition.  Inspired by faculty member and junior class sponsor, Eileen Kramer Dodd, the tradition began in 1926 with juniors wearing a felt green goat symbol on their sweatshirts to breakfast one morning. Not to be out done, the seniors countered with a red devil as their symbol and thus began the Devil-Goat rivalry. The oldest Mary Washington tradition invites friendly competition between the senior and sophomore classes and their rivals, the junior and freshmen classes with different games and competitions on Ball Circle.
