More than 16,000 <a href="http://www.matchinggifts.com/umw/" target="_blank">companies sponsor matching gift programs</a> to support higher education for employees and their families.
<ul>
	<li>Find out if your company has a matching gift program by contacting your Human Resources Department or by checking the <a href="http://www.matchinggifts.com/umw/" target="_blank">matching gift database</a>. If your company does match charitable contributions, request the appropriate form and send it to UMW along with your gift.</li>
	<li>When UMW receives the matching gift from your company, that gift will be combined with your gift to determine your gift club recognition level.</li>
	<li>Many companies also match gifts from retirees, spouses, and outside directors. So please <strong>check all matching possibilities</strong>.</li>
</ul>
