Several programs, scholarships, and naming opportunities require a minimum level of investment as specified and approved by the UMW Board of Visitors.

Endowed gifts made to the University of Mary Washington are managed and invested by the UMW Foundation, a 501 (c) (3) organization. Contact the Office of University Advancement for more information at (540) 654-1024.
