Endowments at Mary Washington are held in perpetuity and are invested for the long term to provide financial stability.

Through the years, hundreds of supporters have established endowments and named them in honor – or in memory – of family, friends, professors, classmates, or businesses.
<p align="left">Endowment gifts enable UMW to offer scholarships to exceptional students, award aid to those with financial need, enhance academic offerings, support museums and specialized centers, provide research opportunities, or reward  teaching and scholarly achievement.</p>
You can create an endowment at Mary Washington with a minimum gift of $25,000. Contact the Office of University Advancement at 540-654-1024.
