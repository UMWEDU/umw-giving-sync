<em><a href="https://giving.umw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/UMW-Scholarship-Luncheon-2016-024.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-47370 size-medium" src="https://giving.umw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/UMW-Scholarship-Luncheon-2016-024-300x214.jpg" alt="UMW Scholarship Luncheon 2016-024" width="300" height="214" /></a></em>Establish an endowed scholarship at Mary Washington with a gift of $25,000 or more. Make a one-time gift or fulfill the commitment over a period of up to five years. Your initial gift is carefully invested and, while the principal remains intact, a portion of the interest it earns funds the scholarship in perpetuity.

You may name a scholarship in honor or in memory of a friend, family member, respected professor, or for a company or organization.

The Office of University Advancement will work with you and/or your advisors to establish the scholarship and to outline criteria for the selection of recipients. If you would like more information about establishing a scholarship, please contact the Office of University Advancement at <a href="mailto:umwgift@umw.edu">umwgift@umw.edu</a>, or call 540-654-1024.

<em>The UMW Office of Advancem</em><em>ent oversees the <strong>establishment</strong> of all scholarships.</em>

<em>The<strong><a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/" target="_blank"> Office of Financial Aid </a>coordinates the application and selection process for scholarship recipients.</strong>
