<strong>Your unrestricted gift to the Fund for Mary Washington:</strong>
<ul>

 	<li>helps advance UMW as a premier public liberal arts and sciences institution</li>
</ul>
With a gift to the <strong>Fund</strong> of $2,500 or more, you will become a member of the <strong>President’s Council.</strong> (Graduates from the last 10 years may join the President’s Council with an annual gift of $500 or more, and graduates 11-15 years out may join with an annual gift of $1,250 or more.) Names of all President’s Council members are listed on a donor wall next to the Office of the President in George Washington Hall.
