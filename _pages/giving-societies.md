(<a href="http://www.matchinggifts.com/umw/">Matching gifts</a> from a donor's employer are combined when determining the donor's level of recognition.)

<strong>PRESIDENT'S COUNCIL</strong>
The President's Council highlights the generosity and loyalty of donors who give $2,500 or more annually to the Fund for Mary Washington. (Graduates of the last ten years may qualify with annual gifts of $500 or more.) Members are invited to special events on campus throughout the academic year and all members are invited to attend the annual Celebration of Giving.
<p style="margin-top: 0"><strong>WASHINGTON SOCIETY</strong>
The Washington Society recognizes those who have supported the University with gifts of $100,000 and more. These gifts may be one-time gifts, or they may reflect a lifetime of giving to support students and UMW programs. Members of the Washington Society receive special invitations to events on campus and are invited to attend the annual Celebration of Giving.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px"><strong>HERITAGE SOCIETY</strong>
The Heritage Society honors those who have established and notified the University of a planned gift. There are no minimum gift levels. Members receive recognition through UMW publications, such as the Heritage newsletter, and are invited to attend special events on campus, including the annual Celebration of Giving.</p>
