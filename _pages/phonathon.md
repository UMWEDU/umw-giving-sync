Each semester, UMW <a href="https://giving.umw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/web-450-NS-Phonathon-5-.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-39371 size-medium alignright" src="https://giving.umw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/web-450-NS-Phonathon-5--300x300.jpg" alt="Phonathon" width="300" height="300" /></a>Phonathon callersÂ contact thousands of UMW alumni and parents to ask for their support of Mary Washington.

Many alumni and parents say they look forward to talking to the student callers, and even plan their giving according to the Phonathon schedule. For <a href="http://giving.umw.edumake-a-gift/umw-phonathon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UMW students</a>, Phonathon is a great way to gain relevant work experience for resume development and career planning.

The Fall <strong>2018</strong> Phonathon runs from <strong>September 20 through November 29</strong>.
