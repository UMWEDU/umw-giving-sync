[slideroll] http://slideroll.com/?s=33hywhs9[/slideroll] The last luncheon was held at the Jepson Alumni Executive Center on Saturday, April 2, 2011. Students took the opportunity to thank their donors for their generosity, and donors enjoyed hearing about their recipients' plans for the future.

The program began and ended with musical performances by the student group Una Voce. Chair of the UMW Foundation Kathleen Shepherd Mehfoud ’70 served as host for the event, and President Richard V. Hurley shared University news. After lunch, Diana Rupert Livingston ’71 told why she decided to establish an endowed scholarship to honor the memory of her mother. Charles S. Reed, Jr. ’11, recipient of the Citizenship Award for Diversity Leadership, represented all student recipients in thanking scholarship donors.
