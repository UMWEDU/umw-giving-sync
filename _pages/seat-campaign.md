Put your name, the name of a loved one, or the name of a favorite professor on one of the best seats in the house. Seats in the Anderson Center include retractable bleachers and 500 chairs with arms.  With a gift of $2,000 to the <span style="font-weight: bold">Fund for Mary Washington</span>, you can dedicate a plaque to be permanently affixed to a chair inside the arena. <a href="https://www.applyweb.com/public/contribute?s=umwand">Make a contribution online </a>to name your seat.

A named seat will make a lasting gift for reunion celebrations, graduations, special birthdays, and retirements.  Only 500 seats are available for dedications, so make your request today.  Call the Office of University Advancement at (540) 654-1024 if you need additional information.
