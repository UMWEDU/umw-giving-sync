As graduation approaches, the Senior Class Gift is an opportunity for all seniors to reflect on their time at the University of Mary Washington and support future generations of students. Each year, seniors participate in fundraisers to leave a “gift” that will enhance the college experience for all students who follow them. In other words, this year-long project is the senior legacy.

<strong> Where should you donate?</strong>

<img class="  alignright wp-image-47739 " src="https://giving.umw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/newgrad-300x202.jpg" alt="newgrad" width="273" height="184" />

The best part of the Senior Class Gift is that you can donate anywhere! We strongly encourage you to support areas at UMW that matter most to you. No matter your passion, there’s a place for you to make an impact in the lives of future students.

Here’s a list of <strong>popular gift designations</strong> for students:
<ul>
	<li>Any student club</li>
	<li>Any athletic team (varsity or club)</li>
	<li>Any department (i.e. Biology, Classics, Spanish, etc.)</li>
	<li>Any college (College of Arts &amp; Sciences, College of Business, College of Education)</li>
	<li><a title="Fund for Mary Washington" href="http://giving.umw.edufundformw/" target="_blank">Fund for Mary Washington</a></li>
	<li>General Scholarship Fund</li>
	<li>James Farmer Multicultural Center</li>
	<li>Student Activities and Engagement ("SAE")</li>
	<li>Study Abroad Assistance Fund</li>
	<li>UMW Libraries</li>
</ul>
<strong>What is the minimum donation?</strong>

There isn’t one! Whether you give $5 or $100, your gift absolutely matters. Participation is just as important as the number of dollars raised. <em>Nearly 60% of all gifts UMW received last year were $50 or under.<img class="  alignright wp-image-47740 " src="https://giving.umw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/newgrad2-300x210.jpg" alt="newgrad2" width="289" height="202" /></em>

Additionally, alumni giving participation is factored into UMW’s annual ranking in <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em>. By giving as a senior, you are improving this ranking!

<strong>How can I donate?</strong>

You have many options for donating: you can either do it online through the <a title="online giving form" href="http://umw.edu/senior-class-giving-gift" target="_blank">online giving form</a>*, in person at events like Giving Day (March 20), or by giving it to one of your Senior Class Gift Officers.

<em>*Please note that, due to our processing server, a minimum of $5 is required to make your gift online.</em>

<strong>Meet your Senior Class Gift Officers!</strong>
