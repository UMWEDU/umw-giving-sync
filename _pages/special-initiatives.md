<a href="https://giving.umw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/web400NS-UMW-65.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-37181" style="margin: 8px;border: black 1px solid" src="https://giving.umw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/web400NS-UMW-65-300x138.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="138" /></a> The need for private gifts at the University of Mary Washington is matched only by the myriad of academic programs and special initiatives to which you can give. Support special projects at the library, bring nationally recognized speakers to campus, or help develop students leaders. 

Private support also is essential to enhance the museums and art galleries and to support musical and theatrical student productions. All enrich the entire Mary Washington community and the Fredericksburg area.
