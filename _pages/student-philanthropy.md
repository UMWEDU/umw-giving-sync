At its core, philanthropy is the generous sharing of ideas, time, money, and passions in order to benefit your community and society in various ways.

<strong>What Is the Purpose of UMW Student Philanthropy?</strong>

UMW Student Philanthropy exists to <strong>educate students on the power of giving and inspire them to give back</strong>. In essence, by supporting and sharing UMW’s culture of philanthropy with others, you are supporting all of the aspects that make UMW a wonderful place to learn and call “home” for so many students.

This may come as a surprise, but tuition and state funding alone do not cover the cost of educating each UMW student. Your education is made possible by funds donated each year by passionate alumni,
faculty, staff, corporations, foundations, and students.

<strong>Do All Gifts Matter?</strong>

Yes! Whether you cont<img class=" wp-image-47582 alignleft" src="https://giving.umw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/898-300x225.jpg" alt="Club fundraising" width="247" height="185" />ribute $1 or $100, your gift absolutely matters. <strong>Participation is just as important as the number of dollars rai</strong><strong>sed.</strong>
<em>Nearly 60% of all gifts UMW received last year were $50 or under. </em>

Additionally, alumni giving participation is factored into UMW's annual ranking in <em>U.S. News &amp; World R</em><em>eport</em>. By giving as a student, you are preparing to become a lifelong Mary Washington supporter.
