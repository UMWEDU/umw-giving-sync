Glav√© &amp; Holmes Architecture is taking extra steps to reuse concrete and many other materials from the existing site. The firm also has performed special studies to sustain and enhance the woodlands around the Amphitheatre.

They began with a survey by Bartlett Tree to study the the health and viability of existing trees within and around the existing Amphitheatre. <strong>Healthy trees expected to survive at least three years and trees in good locations will be protected throughout the construction process.</strong>

Trees exhibiting signs of <a href="http://giving.umw.edu/blog/2017/05/18/defective-diseased-trees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disease or deterioration</a> now, and others in <a href="http://giving.umw.edu/blog/2017/05/18/trees-poor-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than ideal locations</a>, will be removed when site preparation begins in August of 2017.

Once construction work is complete, new plantings will enhance the wooded, park-like setting of the century-old Amphitheatre while providing for long-term sustainability.
