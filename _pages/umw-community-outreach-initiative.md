<p align="center"><b></b><b>Sponsored by the Office of Annual Giving</b></p>
&nbsp;

Thank you for taking time to check out the<strong> UMW Community Outreach Initiative</strong>. This new, grassroots campaign allows students, in need of funding for their projects, research, or organizational activities, a chance to be featured on the University of Mary Washington's website. The purpose of this initiative is to provide unique fundraising opportunities for programs and organizations in the Mary Washington community.

Through an application process, students will submit ideas for their project, research, and/or organizational activities. The selected applicants will be featured on UMW's website and showcased to alumni, parents, friends, and students for financial support. The Office of Annual Giving will also assist the selected applicants by distributing information to alumni, parents, friends, and students of the University.

<b>How do we apply?</b>
<ul>
	<li>Applications will be accepted from <b>September 16, 2013 </b>through <b>November 15, 2013</b>. Follow the instructions on the downloadable Application form available here: <a href="http://giving.umw.eduumw-community-outreach-initiative/application-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-45541">UMW Community Outreach Application</a></li>
</ul>
<b>Who is eligible to apply for funding?</b>
<ul>
	<li>All students currently enrolled and in good standing with the University are eligible to apply on behalf of an organization or group. Projects must be affiliated with the University through an approved organization, academic or research program.<b></b></li>
	<li>Funding will go only to organizational, academic, and/or research groups recognized by the University; not individuals.</li>
</ul>
<b>How will projects be chosen?</b>
<ul>
	<li>Applications will be reviewed and selected by a committee of UMW GOLD (<b>G</b>raduates <b>O</b>f the <b>L</b>ast <b>D</b>ecade) alumni volunteers. Projects will be selected based upon their professionalism, innovativeness, social and community impact, commitment and promotions plan.<b></b></li>
	<li>Projects will be ranked by the UMW GOLD Alumni Committee. The projects ranked in the top four will be initially selected.<b></b></li>
	<li>You will be notified by <b>December 20,2013,</b> if your project was initially selected.</li>
</ul>
<b>What are the project qualifications?</b>
<ul>
	<li>Projects must be completed within a year from the close of your fundraiser. A video report of the project’s progress must be submitted by <strong>November</strong><b> 14, 2014.</b> If you have an ongoing project that has defined completion stages, there may be the opportunity to apply for multiple fundraisers.</li>
</ul>
<b>How long will our project be on the website?</b>
<ul>
	<li>Each of the top four ranked projects will be displayed from <b>January 6, 2014 </b>through <b>November 14, 2014, </b>during which groups will be actively fundraising. Projects will remain on the website until they are <b>fully-funded</b> or <strong>November 14, 2014, </strong>(whichever occurs first). Once projects are funded, they will be archived on the website, so donors can see the impact of their gifts and be inspired to continue to support the UMW community.</li>
</ul>
<b>What if our project is not selected initially?</b>
<ul>
	<li>To start, the four top ranking projects will be displayed on the website. Once a project reaches its fundraising goal, that project will be archived and the next highest ranked project will be added. The website will display four projects at a time through <b>November 14, 2014</b>.</li>
</ul>
<b>How much funding may we request?</b>
<ul>
	<li>Applicants may select their own fundraising goals. Ideally, projects displayed will be of varying sizes and smaller projects have the potential to be funded more quickly. Please only apply for the amount necessary to complete the project. The selection committee reserves the right to approve a project to be displayed a lower funding amount.</li>
</ul>
<b>What happens if the project doesn't reach its fundraising goal in the time allotted?</b>
<ul>
	<li>If a project does not reach its fundraising goal in the time allotted, the donations received will be distributed to the Office of Student Activities and Engagement (SAE) or Academic Department (associated with the project) to be used at their discretion, applying toward the overall mission and purpose of all student organizations.</li>
</ul>
<b>If selected, what next?</b>
<ul>
	<li>As a unique opportunity to share your idea—it is essential for groups to actively promote their own project to ensure its success. If selected, applicants must participate in the following:<b></b>
<ol>
	<li>Utilize any personal social, academic, and professional networks to advertise and promote the project.<b></b></li>
	<li>Take part in the donor acknowledgement process by preparing a personalized “Thank You” note to be sent to project donors through the Office of Annual Giving.</li>
	<li>Document the project through pictures and/or video. A picture/video report of the project’s progress must be submitted by <strong>November</strong><b> 14, 2014, </b>to the Office of Annual Giving. The archived project page will be updated with your project’s report as advertisement to other potential supporters of the <em>UMW Community Outreach Initiative</em>.</li>
