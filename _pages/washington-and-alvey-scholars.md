These prestigious, comprehensive scholarships enable Mary Washington to compete for and attract the best and brightest students.

Candidates for these scholarships are selected from freshmen accepted to the University through the "honors" admission program. Recipients for each are selected based on merit, and the scholarships are renewable for up to four years. The program includes Washington Scholarships for in-state students and Alvey Scholarships for out-of-state students.

<strong>Learn how you can establish a Washington Scholarship endowment with a minimum gift of $600,000 or an Alvey Scholarship endowment with a minimum gift of $1,000,000. Contact the Office of Advancement at 540-654-1024.</strong>
