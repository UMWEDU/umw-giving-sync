Michael Schweder, president of AT&amp;T Mid Atlantic, visited campus to present a $25,000 check for establishment of the AT&amp;T Student Leadership Colloquium. As part of the UMW Center for Honor, Leadership, and Service, the new AT&amp;T Student Leadership Colloquium will provide a robust series of classroom and experiential learning opportunities to accelerate students' personal growth and their leadership abilities. Overall, the program will help enrich the UMW experience and reinforce and sustain the Honor Code as a way of life on the UMW campus and in the lives of our students after they graduate.
