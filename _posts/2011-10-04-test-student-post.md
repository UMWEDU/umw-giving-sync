Despite devotion to his studies and his enthusiastic participation in numerous committee and student leadership activities, he nearly missed his own graduation. He was riding the PBS “American Experience” bus from Washington, D.C., to New Orleans. President Hurley led a special ceremony for Charles when the bus stopped at Mary Washington the following day.
