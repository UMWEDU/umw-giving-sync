"So, Glenn and I thought this bench would be the perfect way to give back to the place we both love so much while also recognizing the Class of 1959." <a href="https://giving.umw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/web465-IMG_0848-bench.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-37701 alignright" style="margin: 9px;border: black 3px solid" src="https://giving.umw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/web465-IMG_0848-bench-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="158" /></a>

Several friends and members of the Class of 1959 joined the couple in the Mayo Courtyard at the Jepson Alumni Executive Center for the unveiling of the bench plaque.

The couple made a gift to Mary Washington to endow the bench, and they then worked with the Office of University Advancement to select the bench location and to approve the wording on the plaque.
