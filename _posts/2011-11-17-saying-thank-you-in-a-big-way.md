Sponsored by the UMW Student Philanthropy Council and the Office of Advancement, the event showcased the many ways in which private gifts enhance the Mary Washington experience.

Students placed gift tags in front of buildings, benches, and other physical features to highlight the impact of private donations. Signs with specific giving statistics told the story behind scholarships and other private gifts from alumni, parents, and friends.

National Philanthropy Day is hosted around the world as a way for charities and nonprofit organizations to show appreciation for the gifts they receive throughout the year.
