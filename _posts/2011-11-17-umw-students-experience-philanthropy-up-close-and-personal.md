She advised UMW students that a good philanthropist must have kindness, collaboration, and common sense.

UMW is one of 30 institutions across the country to participate in a special project through the Learning by Giving Foundation. Headquartered in Boston, Mass., the Learning by Giving Foundation has awarded UMW $10,000 to support the class project. Under the direction of Professor Robert Rycroft, the students have formed a special foundation to evaluate grant proposals from local nonprofit organizations. Students will announce the award decisions in early December.

Buffett said she hopes classes like this will educate students about the joys and the pitfalls of philanthropy. “We believe in putting money where it counts,” said Buffet. “That is helping to empower people.”

The University recorded Buffett’s discussion with the class at the Jepson Alumni Executive Center. <a href="http://vimeo.com/31726244" target="_blank">Click here </a>to view.
