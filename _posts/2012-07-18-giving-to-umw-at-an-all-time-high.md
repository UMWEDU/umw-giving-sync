The generous gifts from 7,787 UMW donors provided support for the Fund for Mary Washington, new and enhanced scholarships, and additional programs within the three colleges, athletics, and UMWâ€™s cultural organizations and museums. In addition to gifts, the University received more than $4 million in new estate plan commitments from 18 Heritage Society members and $1.3 million in multi-year pledges.

Overall, the 2012 fiscal year was an exciting period of discovery as many alumni and friends renewed their connections with the University and now are making plans for additional ways to offer their support to UMW students and programs.
