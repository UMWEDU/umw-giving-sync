More than 120 UMW alumni, parents, and friends enjoyed a unique winter wonderland during the annual Celebration of Giving held November 29, 2012, at the Jepson Alumni Executive Center. Guests were greeted by creative nutcrackers and student carolers.  Inside, three groups representing the UMW Philharmonic performed special holiday tunes.

After dinner, the nutcrackers escorted President Hurley to the stage for a short speech and a special toast.  All in all, it was a terrific way to kick off the holiday season while celebrating the impact of private giving on students and programs at the University of Mary Washington.
