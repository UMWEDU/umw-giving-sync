The Simpson Circle recognizes former members of the UMW Board of Visitors. In February, 2013, all members were invited to attend a special reception and program at the Jepson Alumni Executive Center. Outgoing members of the Board of Visitors were inducted into the Simpson Circle. Following the reception, all attended a Great Lives Lecture in Dodd Auditorium.
