Current and past members of the UMW Board of Visitors gathered February 20, 2014, at the Jepson Alumni Executive Center to recognize the service of  former board members Pamela J. White '74, Daniel K. Steen '84, and Mary Jones Berry. The three retiring board members were officially inducted into the Simpson Circle.

President Richard V. Hurley shared important university updates with the group. Following all festivities, members of the Simpson Circle and current Board of Visitors members attended a performance of <em>Always ... Patsy Cline, </em>a student production at Klein Theatre in duPont Hall.

The concept for the Simpson Circle was originated and approved by former Board of Visitors Rectors – and was then officially established by a BOV resolution in April 2012. The name of the group was chosen, of course, to honor Grellet C. Simpson -- former Chancellor and Mary Washington’s fourth president. It was under his watch in 1972 when legislation was signed to establish Mary Washington’s independence from the University of Virginia. That legislation also created a twelve-member governing board known as the Rector and Visitors of Mary Washington College.
