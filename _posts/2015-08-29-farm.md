Not all gifts to the Mary Washington First Campaign come in the form of cash or checks. Donors also make gifts of personal property, life insurance, real estate, and other assets.

The property is a tree farm with open fields for hay or other cover crops, and plenty of space for growing herbs, flowers, or vegetables. The family home has undergone recent renovations, and the property currently is listed for sale. Proceeds from the sale will be added to an endowed scholarship to benefit deserving Mary Washington students.

<strong>Listing Information</strong>
This little piece of paradise in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains could provide someone an opportunity to get away from the rat race.

<a href="http://giving.umw.edumwfirst/files/2015/08/Front2.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-6709 alignleft" src="http://giving.umw.edumwfirst/files/2015/08/Front2-300x225.jpg" alt="Front2" width="300" height="225" /></a>You’ll love living on 66-plus acres in this modernized and cozy cape-cod style home, featuring an open kitchen, sun porch, main-level master bedroom, bath, laundry room, a spacious second floor, and a semi-finished basement.

The pastoral setting will allow you to awake each morning to awe-inspiring sunrises and drift off to sleep each night with the tranquil sounds of nature. In addition to the tree farm acreage, there are open fields for hay or other cover crops, space for farmer’s market gardens, honeybee production, or a host of other opportunities for enterprising individuals wishing to get back to the land with the benefits of the protected riparian buffer, which<a href="http://giving.umw.edumwfirst/files/2015/08/102_9890.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-6708 alignright" src="http://giving.umw.edumwfirst/files/2015/08/102_9890-300x225.jpg" alt="102_9890" width="300" height="225" /></a> runs through the entire property. For the non-farmer, there is the option of leasing the available agricultural land and farm buildings to neighboring farmers. Forests have been actively managed, and the forested area is a certified stewardship VDOF tree farm.

This property is protected in perpetuity by a Conservation Easement administered by the Virginia Division of Forestry. This easement protects the magnificent open space, natural and scenic vistas.
