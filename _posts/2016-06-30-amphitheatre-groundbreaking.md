The University of Mary Washington recognized two long-time donors June 4, 2016, at a groundbreaking ceremony for the century-old amphitheatre on the Fredericksburg campus. The outdoor facility, slated for renovation, has been renamed the Heslep Amphitheatre, in honor of 1956 alumna Josephine McPherson Heslep and her husband, Donald, of Richmond.

UMW recently received a challenge gift from the Mary Morton Parsons Foundation. <a href="https://giving.umw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Birds-Eye.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-47416 alignright" src="https://giving.umw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Birds-Eye-300x142.jpg" alt="Bird's Eye" width="300" height="142" /></a><strong>If UMW secures NEW gifts totaling $125,000 for the amphitheatre, the Foundation will match with its own contribution of $125,000.</strong>
