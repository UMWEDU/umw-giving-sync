Thanks to hundreds of gifts from alumni, parents, and friends, UMW met the one-year Amphitheatre Challenge to qualify for a $125,000 matching grant from the Mary Morton Parsons Foundation.

As of May 22, 2017, UMW has received a total of $2.75 million in gifts and pledges toward the capital projectâ€™s $3 million goal.
