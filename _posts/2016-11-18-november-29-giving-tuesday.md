<a href="https://giving.umw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Giving-Tues-UMW-Instagram.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-47664 size-medium alignright" src="https://giving.umw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Giving-Tues-UMW-Instagram-300x300.jpg" alt="Photographer" width="300" height="300" /></a><strong>We did it!</strong> Thanks to the generosity of our community and the collaboration of alumni social media ambassadors, we <strong>exceeded our goal</strong> of 200 donors on Giving Tuesday. This global day dedicated to philanthropy is held annually on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, which fell on November 29 this year.

UMW received <strong>228 gifts from 224 donors </strong>in 21 states and two countries on Giving Tuesday, including:
<ul>
	<li>47 young alumni (graduates of the last decade)</li>
	<li>31 Reunion alumni (class years ending in 2 and 7)</li>
	<li>50 parents of current UMW students</li>
	<li>11 faculty and staff</li>
</ul>
<strong>Donors gave a total of $45,550;</strong> and $22,143 of that was in unrestricted giving to the Fund for Mary Washington. Of the 224 donors, 164 designated their gifts to the Fund for Mary Washington—a great show of support for the University’s mission and leadership. Sixty donors gave to other UMW causes, including academic departments, athletic teams, scholarships, the Amphitheatre restoration, and more.

<strong>We sincerely appreciate each donation and are grateful for your commitment to this special place!</strong>
