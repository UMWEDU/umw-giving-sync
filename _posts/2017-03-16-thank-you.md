Mary Wash Giving Day, the University’s first 24-hour giving day, was the largest one-day fundraising effort in Mary Washington history. Held March 14, 2017, the celebration coincided with the 109<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the University’s founding. Snowy roads forced the closure of campus and cancellation of Giving Day events, but donors still turned out in force online to make the day a huge success.

<strong>Final Giving Day results are as follows: </strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>1,218 gifts</strong> to areas across the University, including the Fund for Mary Washington, arts and cultural programs, athletics, academic departments, the Amphitheatre restoration, and scholarships</li>
	<li><strong>1,090 unique donors</strong> (counting each donor once, even if they made more than one gift), -- of that number, <strong>678 were UMW alumni</strong></li>
	<li><strong>$217,255</strong> in gifts and gift commitments, including <strong>$80,655</strong> for the Fund for Mary Washington</li>
</ul>
