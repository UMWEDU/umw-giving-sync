The annual event recognized Mary Washington alumni, parents, friends, and businesses who made gifts of $1,000 and more during the 2016-2017 academic year to support programs showcasing music, museums, the fine arts, theatre, and special lectures.

Acting Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences Keith Mellinger and UMW President Troy Paino talked about the importance of arts and culture in a liberal arts education, as well as the value of sharing events and exhibits within the local community. President Paino thanked donors and said private gifts are essential to preserve and enhance Arts &amp; Culture programming. Following remarks, the galleries at Belmont were opened for private viewing.

The UMW Arts and Culture alliance includes the Crawley Great Lives Lecture Series, Gari Melchers Home and Studio at Belmont, the James Monroe Museum, Dance, UMW Galleries, Music, Philharmonic Orchestra, and UMW Theatre. Donors who make qualifying gifts of $1,000 or more from July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018, will be invited to next year's reception. <a href="http://www.umw.edu/arts/" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about supporting Arts &amp; Culture at UMW.</a>
