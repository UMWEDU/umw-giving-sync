Paino and Kelly Paino welcomed UMW donors to the annual Celebration of Giving held November 30, 2017, at the Jepson Alumni Executive Center.

Members of the Washington Society, Heritage Society, President's Council, and annual donors of $2,500 and more enjoyed hearing University updates from President Paino <a href="https://flic.kr/s/aHsm7AMGwS"><img class="alignright wp-image-48078 size-medium" src="http://giving.umw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/5688-K-Pearlman-Photography-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>and current students.

Guests then took to the dance floor following dancing exhibitions by Strictly Ballroom Dance Studio to nostalgic tunes provided by the Jeff Decker Band.
